After analysing modified bodyfat data set with 251 observations I found out that there is a noticible corelation between BMI and BF categorizing what can affect placing an individual at risk group.
In dataser with of the 251 observations, 100% of males, while 13.1% were obese, 43.4% were overweight, 43.4% were healthy weight when calculated using BMI. However, ??? of males were considered obese based on the BFP.
Conclusion: BFP plays an important role in distinguishing between healthy and obese individuals, as it may have a greater ability to differentiate between lean mass and fat mass compared to BMI. However my works was based on given data set (251 observants) and results cannot be generalized to the entire population without further rigorous investigation
