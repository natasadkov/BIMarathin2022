 . 
What are the business questions this report will answer?

Business Justification (Benefits/ROI)
The analyses of the dataset with dimensions Country name, Region Indicator, Ladder (happiness) score, and facts(metrics) - Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Perceptions of corruption, and Population will be running through linear regression analysis for understanding dependencies and reliability of metrics. The visual dashboard will show a map with dependent metrics and present visual support for understanding data tendency. Ultimately, this reporting will be used to build a prediction model for happiness scores. Success will be measured by showing if there are reliable/unreliable dependencies between metrics and happiness scores.
