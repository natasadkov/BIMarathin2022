Problem Statement:
How categorizing of body fat corelates with categorizing of BMI index


Business Justification:

The analyses of the dataset provided with dimensions Fat Rage, Health Range, Weight Status (BMI)and facts(metrics) - Density, Age,	Weight,	Height,	Neck, Chest,Abdomen, Hip,	Thigh,	Knee,	Ankle,	Biceps,	Forearm,	Wrist. Success will be measured by showing if there are any notable tendency or difference between Fat Rage, Health Range, Weight Status (BM) categorizing.

<pre>

In a given dataset next columns was added in MySQL workbench:

 - Siri index = (495 /density) - 450)
 - Brozek index = (4.57 /density) - 4.142) * 100)
 - BMI = (weight * 703) / (height * height)
 - Weight status (BMI) - underweight/healthy weight/overweight/obesity
 - fat_range - dangerously low/poor/good/excellent/dangerously heigh
 - health_range = non-healthy/ healthy
